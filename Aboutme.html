<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Rovence Kabahinda . I am a third year Software Engineering student at Makerere University.</p>
<p>I have passion in website designing, software and mobile app development plus Graphic designing. </p>
<p>As an undergraduate, I have balanced a rigorous course load and a number of extracurricular activities that have
    allowed me to enhance my skills.
</p>
<p>Specific to my course, through my academic project work, I have abilities in Graphics
    designing with Adobe illustrator and Photoshop and In design, web development,Content Management Systems and Database management.
</p>
<p>I have an understanding of materials, and have
    practiced different programming languages such as Java Script, Node js, reactjs, Php, python for datascience
    plus html and css.
</p>

<p>For example, during my second year recess term, I along with my other three teammates
    created a Diabetes Prevalence Prediction(DPP) model using python and Django frame work. This model takes in
    a patient's data such as glucose levels, red blood cell count, history of hypertension and among other signs
    and symptoms. This then learns on the given data and can therefore tell the doctor whether the patient has
    or does not have diabetes. There after recommend a kind of treatment accordingly. For  more details about DPP model visit <a href="https://github.com/Kabahindarovence13/RECESS_PROJECT_2019.git">Link</a>
